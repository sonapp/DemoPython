# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
* The idea behind this project was to predict accurate price of a house with help of Machine Learning model. We built this Web Application where user can come and predict price of a house.
* User inputs like total number of bedrooms, bathrooms, sq. ft area, basement area, total floors etc are taken into consideration while predicting the price.
* Random Forest Algorithm is used to train the dataset and 88.3% accuracy is obtained.
* User can save their data of house prices by creating an account.
